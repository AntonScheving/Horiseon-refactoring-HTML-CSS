# Horiseon-Refactoring-HTML-CSS

## Description

This repository is where we develop the Horiseon website. 
We have recently completed a full refactoring of the Horiseon webpage. The front-end web developer has refactored the HTML and CSS to include semantic tags and 'alt' descriptions, consolidated CSS selectors and organised the file structure to make the source code more accessible. The web page is now more SEO friendly and follows accessibility standards. This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.
